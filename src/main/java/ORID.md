# Daily Summary

## **O: Objective**
Today, we learned the three main principles of Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.  
The instructor guided us step by step to implement exercises that demonstrated these principles.  
In the afternoon, we participated in a code refactoring competition, followed by a team outlook meeting.

## **R: Reflection**
Overall, the learning experience was good. I followed the instructor’s guidance and gradually understood the content.  
The code refactoring competition was quite exciting. Although we didn’t place highly, I believe our team did well and demonstrated strong teamwork.  
During the outlook meeting, we identified many areas for improvement.

## **I: Improvement**
- My proficiency with hotkeys could be better, so I should use them more regularly in daily tasks.

## **D: Decision**
- Implement the action points from the outlook meeting.
- Engage more in problem discussions and solutions to promote better team collaboration.
